# HDP EVM ByteCode

## Prerequisites

### [HDP CLI](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp-cairo)

To install run:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HerodotusDev/hdp-cairo/main/install-cli.sh | bash
```

### [Bun](https://bun.com/)

To install run:

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Before first run

```
hdp-cli link
cd input && bun i && cd ..
```

## Development

To run see commands in [`run.sh`](./run.sh) or run it directly:

```
./run.sh
```

### TODOs

#### Next Goals:

- [x] execute simple bytecode (DONE! run ERC20 decimals())
- [ ] execute more complex bytecode accessing storage slots
- [ ] execute even more complex bytecode - a proxy running the code of another contract

#### TODOs:

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Search the code for `TODO: @herodotus [<subject>]`

- [x] implement everything in [hdp-backend.cairo](./src/evm/hdp_backend.cairo)

  - [x] storage - todos with `[storage]`
  - [x] account - todos with `[account]`
    - [ ] `fetch_bytecode` remains unimplemented, it needs HDP support.
    - [ ] `is_deployed` currently returns `true` always, unless it panics, needs a proper way of handling this check

- [x] fix precompiles in [interpreter.cairo](./src/evm/interpreter.cairo) search for: `[precompiles]`
  - [ ] two precompiles need HDP to support them first: `EcAdd`, `EcMul`
  - [ ] also everything based on `secp256r1` won't work until HDP supports it
- [x] resolve `[misc]` TODOs along the way
- [x] Cleanup & brainstorm how to tackle Environment and Message structs setup in [lib.cairo](./src/lib.cairo)

  - [x] Especially Environment stuff like gas price, chain id, prevrandao, block number, gas limit, timestamp, coinbase, base fee - they all have to come from somewhere
    - [ ] Only field missing is `prevrundao`
    - [ ] Better setup is places in `new_main` but needs HDP to support bytecode first.

- [ ] Create a new folder `solidity` for testing contracts to use
  - [ ] basic function, just simple bytecode
  - [ ] more advanced functions
    - [ ] using storage slots
    - [ ] using precompiles
  - [ ] proxy contract
